    <h2>Journal week 1</h2>
    <b>9.2.22 - This week we learned about models and the types of models. These models were used for replicas of certain products. We will be using these models in tinkercad next week where we will attempt to pop a balloon.</b>
    
    <h2>Journal week 2</h2>
    <b>9.9.22 - This week we learned about tinkercad and the modelelling ascpects and UI needed to become proffesionals, and it's very fun to model. Seeing a model in real life and recreating our tinkercad is even cooler though because you make something not real into something you can touch.</b>
    
    <h2>Journal week 3</h2>
    <b>9.16.22 - Today we made boats out of paper and put them in water while adding weights. Out of Andy, Noah, absent Alex, and I, Noah was the boat we used. It floated boyant for 5 minutes while staying in a corner for the majority of the time. Construction of our balloon popping models has also started. </b>
    
    <h2>Journal week 4</h2>
    <b>9.23.22 - This week we started testing out our projects and seeing if all the components work when put together. After trial and error we got it to work once in a test run, however when we recorded it, it didn't work due to the car breaking.</b>
    
    <h2>Journal week 5</h2>
    <b>9.30.22 - we've recorded the goldberg projects and have started our dive into computer engineering, today we dissected old chromebooks and its interesting to see all the parts layed out, it shows you a perspective on how advanced computers and their components are. It's also interesting to see how everything plays a part.</b>
    
    <h2>Journal week 6</h2>
    <b>10.7.22 - Today we saw how important the specifics of steps in a procedure by making pb and j sandwiches with vague details. This shows an example of how precise you need to be with your code while sending an input to a computer.</b>
